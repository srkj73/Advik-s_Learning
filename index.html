    <p>My favourite hobby is "Reading". I have started reading when I was 5 years. There are two types of books.They are fiction and Non-Fiction.Fiction is the type of books which are told about actual events or history of a region.Non-Fiction means events,characters and settings made by people to entertain others. I like Non-Fiction as well as Fiction as Non-Fiction includes Fantasy,while Fiction includes knowledgeable. I like reading a lot. In my free time, I always read books.</p>

    <p>My favourite book is "The Dragon of Fortune". It is written by Geronimo Stilton. It is an epic adventure in which a mouse called geronimo has lost his key which takes him to the Kingdom of Fantasy. He made many new friends on the way and fought with the twin sister of Blossom(queen of fairies[protogonist]) Wither(queen of bad fairies[antogonist])It is a good book. You shall too read it. </p>
